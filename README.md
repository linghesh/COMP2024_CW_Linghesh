INTRODUCTION
------------
The objective of Frogger is to assist frogs across a busy, multi-line highway, a highway median, an embankment and a treacherous river. At each stage, there are unique challenges and obstacles for players to work around, including the fact that Frogger has no physical defenses. Each stage is laid out exactly the same way, but the number of opponents, speed and level of difficulty changes.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
Frogger game don't required any external source, but to make the game more interactive and attractive we use different background sounds at different places and also include some effects of wind, smoke.


CHANGES
-------
Initially, I changed the GUI of the game. Decrease the size of window and used assets with little more resolution.
Previous version look blurry because of images used in the game. I used more background music on different triggers, and use .ogg files for music.
Change the project structure, previously everything is in the src folder, now we have 2 folders one for resources and other one for java files. 
Make game more interactive as compare to previous. 
Added 4 more levels in the game total levels are now 6, in level 1 there is 1 goals with minimum difficulty. In level 2 there are 2 goals with little more difficulties like speed of traffic increases and in level 3 there are 3 goals and time limit is same, with some high speed cars and trucks.
I am maintaining a text file of all the scores player got.  

HOW TO PLAY
-----------
When you reach the home, you win the game and you can play the game again. If you run into an enemy bug, you will die and the game will start over. The enemy bugs are running across the screen at random locations and random speeds. Use the arrow keys to move left, right, forward or backward.
There are mainly 3 levels in the game. Level 1 starts with 1 goals with less difficulty. As level increases number of goals and speed of traffic increases. At maximum there are 6 goals with 6 levels.


INSTALLATION
------------
Pull the code.
Import it in any IDE like NetBeans, IntelliJ, and Eclipse.

Frogger is ready to go.
